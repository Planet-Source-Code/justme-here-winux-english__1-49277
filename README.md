### Description

Ok for everyone that has requested it here is the english version of the amazing windows linux winux program. It is around 98% converted from french to english so there should be very little if any problems understanding any part of it. The entire program is very well commented. Also the username is root: and password is: admin (after you login under root you can create a new user account - just like linux!)
